title: Starting with templates

A good starting-point for developing your own plugin is taking a look at the [documentation](https://inventree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extend/plugins/).

You could also use one of the current plugins as a sample. Search for something that is similar to the wanted functionality and use it as a template.

{% include alert.html content="Be aware of the licenses of plugins and the restrictions that come with them." type="warning" %}

The ecosystem is just getting started so if something does not make sense for you or could be done easier: We welcome feedback and invite you to submit a feature request to [InvenTree](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md). If you have remarks about this platform: we have [discussions enabled](https://github.com/invenhost/repo.invenhost.com/discussions).
